# EVM Contracts

This directory contains the Solidity contracts for intent-based bridge platform implementation.

## Intent Contract Interface

### Initiate Intent
```solidity
function initiate(
  address asset,
  uint256 amount,
  uint256 targetChain,
  bytes calldata receiver,
  uint256 tip,
  uint256 salt
) external
```

Creates a new intent for cross-chain transfer:
- `asset`: Address of the token to transfer
- `amount`: Amount of tokens to transfer
- `targetChain`: Chain ID of the destination chain
- `receiver`: Address of the receiver on the target chain (in bytes format)
- `tip`: Amount of tokens to pay as fee for the cross-chain transfer
- `salt`: Random value to ensure uniqueness of the intent ID

### Fulfill Intent
```solidity
function fulfill(
  bytes32 intentId,
  uint256 amount,
  address asset,
  address receiver
) external
```

Fulfills an existing intent:
- `intentId`: Identifier of the intent to fulfill
- `amount`: Actual amount of tokens being transferred (may differ from intent's amount)
- `asset`: Address of the token being transferred
- `receiver`: Address of the recipient on the target chain
