# Introduction

## What is Speedrun?

Speedrun is an intent settlement protocol focused on delivering blazing fast cross-chain transactions while maintaining strong security.

Built on ZetaChain's interoperability layer, Speedrun leverages this foundation to enable rapid token transfers between different blockchains without compromising on security.

The platform's "speedrunner" mechanism creates a competitive environment where liquidity providers race to fulfill transfer intents as quickly as possible, dramatically reducing wait times compared to traditional cross-chain solutions.

## Why Speedrun

ZetaChain architecture ensures trustlessness and robust security but this architecture introduces higher latency compared to centralized bridges. Speedrun introduces intent-based execution, turning latency into a market opportunity. ZetaChainâ€™s high reliability makes it a safe and predictable foundation for third-party fulfillers to earn fees with low risk

## Features

- **Fast**: Use intent model to complete transactions directly on the target
- **Secure**: Use ZetaChain interoperability to ensure intents are settled
- **Permissionless**: Leverage ZetaChain for decentralization and rely on a permissionless model for intent fulfillement

## Who Can Use Speedrun

- **Crypto Users**: Access the [speedrun.exchange](https://speedrun.exchange) platform directly to make fast cross-chain transfers
- **Developers**: Integrate Speedrun contracts and APIs into applications to create cross-chain dApps with fast processing
- **Fulfillers**: Provide liquidity on target chains and fulfill intents to receive intent fees
