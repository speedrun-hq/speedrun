# Introduction

## What is Speedrun

Speedrun is an intent settlement protocol designed for **blazing fast cross-chain transactions** with robust security. Built on **ZetaChain as interoperability layer**, it enables rapid token transfers between blockchains without compromising security or decentralization.

> For example, you can use Speedrun to send **10 USDC from Base to Arbitrum in under 5 seconds**

## Why Speedrun

**Speedrun is built for fast cross-chain transactions with a focus on strong security.**

While ZetaChain’s architecture offers **trustlessness, composability, and robust safety guarantees**, it may introduce latency compared to centralized bridges. Speedrun introduces an intent-based execution model, turning that latency into a market-driven opportunity.

By allowing **third-party fulfillers** to complete user intents immediately and rely on ZetaChain for finality, Speedrun ensures both **speed** and **security**, without compromise.
## Features

- 🔥 **Fast**: Use intent model to complete transactions directly on the target
- 🛡️ **Secure**: Use ZetaChain interoperability to ensure intents are settled
- 🏛️ **Permissionless**: Leverage ZetaChain for decentralization and rely on a permissionless model for intent fulfillement

## Who Can Use Speedrun

- 🧑‍🚀 **Crypto Users**: Access the [speedrun.exchange](https://speedrun.exchange) platform directly to make fast cross-chain transfers
- 👷 **Developers**: Integrate Speedrun contracts and APIs into applications to create cross-chain dApps with fast processing
- 🤖 **Fulfillers**: Provide liquidity on target chains and fulfill intents to receive intent fees

## Technical Documentation

This documentation site will expand to include:

- 🔌 API references
- 📦 Smart contract documentation
- 📘 Integration guides
- 🛠️ Fulfillment tooling and setup

## Vision

**🌐 Expand Beyond EVM**

Speedrun will go beyond EVM chains to support non-EVM ecosystems such as Solana, Sui, and more — becoming a truly **universal cross-chain settlement protocol**.

**⚡ Build Fast Cross-Chain Apps**

Our vision isn’t limited to token transfers. Speedrun will support arbitrary cross-chain smart contract calls, enabling developers to build **blazing fast cross-chain applications** powered by intents.

Stay tuned — more coming soon!
