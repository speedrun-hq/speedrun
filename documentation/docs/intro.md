# Introduction

## What is Speedrun

Speedrun is an intent settlement protocol focused on delivering blazing fast cross-chain transactions while maintaining strong security. Built on ZetaChain's interoperability layer, Speedrun leverages this foundation to enable rapid token transfers between different blockchains without compromising on security.

## Why Speedrun

ZetaChain architecture ensures trustlessness and robust security but this architecture might introduce higher latency compared to centralized bridges. Speedrun introduces intent-based execution, turning latency into a market opportunity. ZetaChainâ€™s high reliability makes it a safe and predictable foundation for third-party fulfillers to earn fees with low risk

## Features

- **Fast**: Use intent model to complete transactions directly on the target
- **Secure**: Use ZetaChain interoperability to ensure intents are settled
- **Permissionless**: Leverage ZetaChain for decentralization and rely on a permissionless model for intent fulfillement

## Who Can Use Speedrun

- **Crypto Users**: Access the [speedrun.exchange](https://speedrun.exchange) platform directly to make fast cross-chain transfers
- **Developers**: Integrate Speedrun contracts and APIs into applications to create cross-chain dApps with fast processing
- **Fulfillers**: Provide liquidity on target chains and fulfill intents to receive intent fees
